## Pacific Union Web Site

https://www.pacificunion.com/

* There's a find-an-agent page but no-become-an-agent page



# Observations on the https://compas.com Web site



# Coding aspects

I have had a look at the source code of the home page and several other pages

## CSS

Archaic scripts from single person operations are not the sort of scripts you expect to find in billion dollar company web sites



## JavaScript

Looking at the code here are some scripts that I see

### SystemJS


/*
 * SystemJS v0.19.40
 */
* Configurable module loader enabling backwards compatibility workflows for ES modules in browsers.
* Current release is 2.1.1
* Previous release: https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/tree/0.21


### Angular
* npm:angular@1.5.6.js
* Last update 2 years ago

The current release of Angular is 7.0

* https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/react-vs-angular-vs-vue-js-a-complete-comparison-guide-d16faa185d61

Angular was hot in 2014.  It's much less hot these days.


### npm:babel-runtime@5.8.35
* 2015

### Variable nd ID names

A number of IDs and variable names refer to "uc" and "urban-compass" - as in 'uc-globalHeader-logotype'.
The company changed its web address from urbancompass to compass after acquiring the URL in 2015.

### Generally

The code for compass.com is

* Old
* Contains much useless node.js stuff
* Contains too much source code. It looks like the scripts were meant to be compiled or minified but that seems to have never happened.

The code of the site might be forgivable for an industrial company or a bank.
Compass, however, purports to be a tech leader. The code of their web site in no way macthes up with that expectation
