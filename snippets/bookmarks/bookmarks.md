### lists of useful tags

The current set of categories in 'Opentecture Bookmarks View-a-line' does not feel viable. If nothing else, a bookmark could and should be assigned multiple categories.

In essence assigning categories to bookmarks is a problem similar to deciding the length of a piece of string: the time it takes to decide is always longer than the piece of string. See also Clay Shirky's article (link below).

What we want is an infinitely adjustable who, what, when, where and why method we want to be able to answer questions like these:

Who is the creator of the page?

What is primary purpose of the organization
- Example three.js creates a software library
* What are secondary aspects
	- Example: Three.js produces: documentation, examples, issue management, utilities

So coming up soon there will be a 'Opentecture Bookmarks View-a-line-by-tags' script.

## Current working set of tags

I have looked for lists of useful tags or keywords but have not yet found anything useful. Therefore I will start by building one from scratch as follows:

who: person, organization
when: time, day, year, life-cycle, short tern interest, long term interest, one-off/scheduled
what / produces: goods (tangible, physical) / services (intangible )
what / industry tags: academia, aec, furniture, industrial, software, hardware
what / physicality: online / downloadable / physical
what / media is: html, audio, video
what / cost: $$$ / fee / free / FOSS
where / location : country?
how / structure tags: formal/informal


More services tags with usage still to be determined:


* construction / fabricating
* content generating
	* portal
		examples: stackoverflow
	* articles - of longer duration / reference
		* examples: wiki, documentation, manifesto
	* news - timely
* consulting / design
* laws / standards / licenses
	* examples: webgl, creative commons
* code libraries
	* examples: three.js, python,
* management / logistics / QA / hr
* software
	* examples: Autodesk
* training / education / support
* utility
	* examples: AWS / ISP
