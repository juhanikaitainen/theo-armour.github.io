## Itinerary

I plan on coming back to SLO Tuesday, spending the night, then going down to Joshua tree on Wednesday.
I plan on spending the weekend there, mostly camping and doing day hikes, or just 1 night backpacking since water access is very limited.
Then, drive out to zion. A friend of a friend lives in the town of Springdale, the town by the park, so I'll spend a night there, then spend 4-5 days scrambling around (Angels landing, observation point, kolob, east/west rim trails, la verkin...).

Then, escalante for the coyote gulch back country trail.
Probably three days? Spend the first night in the town there to restock on food, shower.

Then, either out straight to monument valley, or stop by bears ears for a night.

Then either grand canyon or Bryce canyon.
3-5 days.

Then death valley!
I plan on being there for the last week, and maybe have some friends meet me there.
