The "panel" is interesting. So far I am not using it. Mostly because the display of text is small and Screen is quite dark.But perhaps give it in old fashion multiple monitor ways.There may be ways to sing about it as an entirely new device or just a  thing in its own right.

First thought. The issue is that if you have multiple windows of a browser then all windows have the same zoom setting.

if the issue is small text is then use a second browser like Firefox for the panel. then you can set a size in fact browser which may be different than the font size in the Chrome browser.

Firefox in the panel is looking really really good!

The text is large invisible. 

The second issue is what do you use the panel for. I think I will need to build a special app just for the panel. I should be able to dictate, right, and draw. Perhaps in 3 different panels

Looks like Firefox allows different tabs to have different zoom settings which is interesting
