Tamarindo


What conditions or criteria make for a worthy Christmas holiday? What potential camaraderie could drag us out of our comfy houses? What possible venue can motivate us to poo-poo the issues of traveling during a holiday?

Here are some thoughts:

TL:DR Tamarindo might not be bad

Geography

* Ocean facing beaches good for surfing
* Estuary and protected beaches: good for snorkeling
* Rivers: good for jungle boats trips to see crocodiles
* Volcanoes and mountains in the vicinity: good for hiking / exploring


Concierge & experience curation service

* Knows the prices and on our side of the table
* Knows what doctor/clinic to see when one of the urchins steps on a sea urchin
* Knows where to shop for fresh food and delicacies and good wines
* Helps plan culture, history and geography excursions
* Can organize transport for a group / airport pickups


Accommodations

* Bedroom and bathroom for every two peeps
* Cooking and eating area for big enough for the group
* Eminently walkable to beach and/or town
* OK for bare feet


Bonus Points

* Somebody who knows youngsters with local language and English skills for the youngsters with us to play with
* Family or old time friends in the neighborhood
* Ways of getting out of the rich white people bubble
* Talking to peeps in the locale who are not just serving the tourists
* Single connection maximum flights to destination via major world airline from CDG/LHR/SFO/SBA/LAX/ATL

* Lock in his office / wine bar


### Conclusion

The last times we were all together was fo Tania's 50th birthday at Chateau Brecourt in France and Isabelle and my 40/5Oth. I remember these as wonderful family gatherings that continued the traditions of all our families of origin. I would like to think that these gatherings may again now and onwards.

From my research Tamarindo - with Lock's assistance and help from Nancy Hovey - could be a likely venue for passing the tradition on from my generation and siblings onto the next generation and cousins.

2. I've been on Omeprazole since the beginning of the year.  For the first time in decades I have suffered no instances of food stuck in my esophagus. Your recommendation significantly improved the quality of my life. Thank you.


But as with many medications there are risks:
Proton pump inhibitors: Risks of long-term use / http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgh.13737/full


What is a workable, minimal interventions?  I tried Zantac for ten days, but felt food sticking so I resumed the Omeprazole. Since July I've been on a 20mg dose taken as you suggested 20 minutes before eating. When current batch runs out, I will try a 15mg dose. Might you have any observations or recommendations regarding these self-experiments?


3. We are scheduled for a colonoscopy December 14. As with my two prior colonoscopies, I plan for no anesthesia. if so, will it be OK if I get home without a helper?
