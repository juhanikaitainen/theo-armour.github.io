# Food Eat Diet


## Tips

### Containers

* Get food out of plastic and into glass as soon as open
	* Makes it pretty to bring to desk
	* Makes faster to get out and put back
	* Do transfer at sink to make it easier to pick up drips and spills


### Microwave

* Never wave plastic

### Buying food

* Never buy much more than you will eat in a day or two
