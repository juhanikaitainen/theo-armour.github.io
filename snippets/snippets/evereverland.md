## Science Of Persuasion

1. Reciprocity.
	* Obligation to give when you receive.
	* Be the first to give.
	* Personalized and unexpected.
	* When you ask, likely to say "yes"
2. Scarcity.
	* If it's scarce, we want it more.
	* People want more of those things there are less of
	* Use this by highlighting the Benefits, Uniqueness and Possible Loss.
3. Authority.
	* We are more likely to comply with a request if it is coming from a perceived authority/expert.
	* People will follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts
4. Consistency.
	* We want to be consistent with our past commitments, even if the initial commitment is much smaller.
	* Looking for commitments that can be made
5. Liking.
	* We like people who are similar, who give us compliments and who co-operate with us.
	* People who are similar to us
	* People who pay us compliments
	* People who cooperate with us
6. Consensus
	* If others (especially similar others) are doing it, then we are more likely to do it ourselves.
	* People will look to the actions of others to determine their own
