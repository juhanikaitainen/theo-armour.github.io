### Beyond compare

* 2016-12-29 Still the best

If you happen to have CRCs already calculated for files, then comparing them is quite fast.
But here's the catch:  Beyond Compare has to read every byte of each file to calculate the CRCs,
so why not do the (more accurate) binary comparison instead?
Binary comparisons can also be faster, because they stop reading each file as soon as a difference is found.
