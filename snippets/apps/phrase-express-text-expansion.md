## Auto Text Expander for Google Chrome

https://github.com/carlinyuen/ChromeAutoTextExpander

Known Issues
* I can't get this to work in Google Docs due to how Docs is architected. T_T
* Similarly, Facebook comments is unavailable due to ReactJS's system.
* Also, this doesn't work in Google Hangouts due to cross-origin policies.

## About

https://www.guidingtech.com/51251/chromebook-keystrokes-time-savers/

Since Auto Text Expander doesn’t sync with devices, I keep long snippets in Google Keep. Google Keep works in any browser and any device. When I first got my Chromebook, I moved many of my snippets to Keep. One unique function of Google Keep is it’s ability to do OCR on pictures. That saves time for longer snippets.
