* But where are Taylor Swift and Lady GaGa?



## Diana

The agenda  should include supporting Diana with
* Access to an elder care case manager
* An active support group - 5 or so peeps monitoring
* A plan, a mission, a vision

I propose this meeting because I have been with Dians several times recently just before her scheduled surgery - which thankfully was postponed.

I observed the following

* Her support group is non-existent
* Her social life and connection to humanity sucks
* Her future is unplanned
* Her admin support is weak
* Her ability to do anything useful is compromised
* Her connections to reality are weird
