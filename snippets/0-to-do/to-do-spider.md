* creates the essence of the design - the schematic of a building

### gbXML.org viewer

Tip: Fastest way to view a gbXL file

The faster, easier, cheaper ways people may access you building project data, the more likely a better outome for your efforts. A small but signicant speeed-up can be as simple as providing a simple URL to access your project data.

* Problem: You want to show your parents the project you are building but they only have an iPhone with email and web access. Simple to type URL is good.
* Problem: Your colleagues are forgful, don't take good notes or keep bookmarks, but they really need see the files? Easy to remember URL is good.
* Problem: You are on site and there are 88 people standing in front of you wanting see the changes. They all have their devices, you just need to shout out the link they need. The short and fast URL is good.


Fastest way from a gbXML file to an interactive 3D visualization

* in your browser address bar type "gbxml.org" then press enter 
    * ( even faster on a computer: type "gbxml" and press Alt-Enter and ".org" is added automagically )
* In the top menu click: "Viewer" and - bingo! - you are in the viewer



* Problem: The developers want to discuss your project among themselves before agreeing the work. They want to see if the work meets their spacing needs and costing requirements
* Problem: Your client wants access to a schematic of your project so they can work out office assignments, but they don't have Revit.
