encyclopedia
* https://www.britannica.com/topic/encyclopaedia
	* The present concept of the encyclopaedia as an essential starting point from which one can embark on a voyage of discovery, or as a point of basic reference on which one can always rely, dates only to the 18th century.
	* Encyclopaedia writing requires teamwork in which each article is edited in relation to others closely connected by subject. If a writer makes a statement that is partly qualified or totally contradicted in another article, the contributions of both writers must be scrutinized by the editorial staff, whose job it is to effect some kind of eventual agreement. Truth can be viewed from many standpoints, and references to any controversy may produce problems demanding all the skill and tact of the editors to resolve, particularly when the reputation of the writer is at stake in a signed article.
	* For example, an account of the [Korean War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Korean-War) might vary according to whether it was written by a North or South Korean, a Chinese, or an American writer.
	* Seems to say that an enc is a summation of knowledge as agreed by authors and contributors. Accepts bias. Accepts need to update

Definitions
* https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/encyclopedia
	* a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a particular branch of knowledge usually in articles arranged alphabetically often by subject
* https://www.dictionary.com/browse/encyclopedia
	* a  book, set of  books, optical disc, mobile device, or  online informational resource containing articles onvarious topics, usually in  alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of  knowledge or,  lesscommonly, all aspects of  one subject.
* https://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/literature-and-the-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/literature-general/encyclopedia
	* **encyclopedia,** compendium of knowledge, either general (attempting to cover all fields) or specialized (aiming to be comprehensive in a particular field).
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia
	* A study by  _[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal) "Nature (journal)")_  in 2005 found that Wikipedia's science articles were roughly comparable in accuracy to those of  _[Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica")_, containing the same number of serious errors and about 1/3 more minor factual inaccuracies, but Wikipedia's writing tended to be confusing and less readable.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia#cite_note-GilesJ2005Internet-31)  Encyclopædia Britannica refuted the study's conclusions, deeming the study fatally flawed.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia#cite_note-Britannica-rebuttal-32)
	* Many academics, historians, teachers, and journalists reject Wikipedia as a reliable source of information, and Wikipedia is itself not a reliable source according to its own standards because of its openly editable  [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki")model.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia#cite_note-33)  [Critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Wikipedia "Criticism of Wikipedia")  argue Wikipedia exhibits  [systemic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_bias "Systemic bias").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia#cite_note-35)

using mozilla text editor and github API, I have a nice little content management system going
- similar to my PHP system of years ago.

This editor brings up all sorts of issues

html vs markdown
diary as google docs vs html vs markdown

first editor where I understand most everything
- that I feel I could enhance


## Alpha Vantage thoughts

need to break big files into many smaller files
Use file system API - not standard
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem
* https://www.noupe.com/design/html5-filesystem-api-create-files-store-locally-using-javascript-webkit.html
use local storage?
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API
use Glitch

## 2017-12-31 ~

maybe I should get my diary over to Markdown???

gbXML View: user experience moving along nicely

Prediqtiv: changing over to alpha-vantage. Could be quite good
Mozilla-text-editor: looking quite nice


Boostnotes look interesting

## 2017-12-10 yelp review

Fish and Farm

In essence, Fish and Farm is the place where peeps staying 'upstairs' at Club Quarters come down to eat. It's also where - like many peeps in the 'hood - I come to eat. Why? Because Fish and Farm serves chef-prepared meals 24/7. 'Chef-prepared' means - hello - prepared by people who actually and truly eat the food they prepare. The typical Club Quarters peeps are airline staff, frequent fliers, former-bank robbers, whatever. In otnd the worher words, peeps, who need to eat tasty food or otherwise they are unhappy.

OK, you got the picture. So do start with the mussels. From Prince Edward Island. Cooked Mariniere - with garlic, parseley and vin blanc. Or try the Basquaise with Roasted Bell pepper, parseley, vin blanc and Spanish Chorizo. Then try the warm cheese galette and the artichoke sala.

The difficulty is the main course. Today there are eleven choices. I want one of each. Each dish is a North American classic. And, guess what, they are classy representives of their representations.  Each is good enough to eat time and time again.

Tonight it was a less frequented path: the vegetable risotto. And it delivered. The warm, cozy large _arborio_ rice was complimented by zucchini, broccoi and all goodly, healthy veggies to eat.

Um, but here is the real thing!! It has taken me three hours to write this review. Why? Because I am sitting at the bar at Fish and Farm and all these nice talkative peeps have sat next to me. I am a techie and I've talked tech. I'm born in Boston and I've talked East Coast. I do business around the world and I've talked frequent flier. What more can you talk/ask for?

Anyway, it's time to close and I cannot do so so without mentioning the general manager, Michael. Actually, I talk to him as Michel because he is totally French-speaking. Of course, he speaks a bunch of other languages. I do find that his Tagalog could use help. Whatever. The main thing is that if you want to have a photo-opportunity with a classy, totally well-dressed gentleman then you can do no better than giving Michel a hug

And, so, if yhttps://github.com/absence/absence.github.ioou want a tasty meal in the San Francisco Financial District 24/7, then Fish and Farm is a welcoming hang-out.

Every time you switch projects, open up your journal and enter the following three things:

1 Note the time. Most people will find having these timestamps to be useful to look back on.

2 Write a few sentences about what you just worked on. “What project did I just finish? Are there any parts of that project that I’m still thinking about?” Use complete sentences rather than one word answers. “Email. Yes.” is not a valid answer.

3 Write a few sentences about what you’re about to work on. “What is the first action of the project I’m about to start? How should I approach getting the project done?”


Rename Next Action to First Action.

First Action makes it easier to narrow in on a smaller action,


22:56 ~ killing email

23:14 ~  Youtube shortcuts
 To pause a video press K. To fast forward press L. To rewind press J. To watch frame by frame forward or backward, press the period or comma key.

Add more shortcuts to Auto Text Expander


## 2016-11-17

eeePC: Next day. Internet connection failed over night. Trying again. Looking good.

Testing testing 1 2 3. Can we edit using Codeanywhere with my Google Pixel C? Looks good.


Adding Crouton to Pixel was easier than I thought. Ubuntu looking good - though only r14 is fully supported.
Crouton means I can use Atom editor and Beyond Compare on the Pixel.The only issue is that logging out and sutting dpwn takes much longer.


Codeanywhere in the browser is a keeper. Links easily to DropBox. Edits text files very nicely. Works on all three Pixels.
Has auto save. Can refresh and see what happened on another device. Supports AutoText expander

Now how about them diaries??

Need a Google Apps script that open all 366 files and exports them to ASCII

Then would like a way that enables me to write sequentially, but add the data to the day files.

Also dashboard needs updating

Ditto new tab page

### Installing Ubuntu

_multo complicato_


19:10  trying to get ubuntu on thheop. Got all the wahy there the last time but shutting down instead of reloading was the wrong thing to do


20:10 https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/this-dinner-series-is-getting-people-to-talk-about-being-black-in-america

00:05 Wow! that took some time and some doing, but it looks like I have Ubuntu working on thheop.

the trick is that you have to install from one HD to another HD

Otherwise you never get to the Allocate size screen.


2016-11-15

deciding to move my diary from google docs back to text.

Or Markdown. Which should it be?

looks like it should be in text format because then I can use voice recognition inside of Dropbox on my phone.




## Thheop

Thheep: BIOS reports HD is full
So remove hard disk. Delete some files
HD still has issues. OK let's move the machine to Ubuntu.
Rediscover bit but. But Thheop only boots from CD or HD. Many hours failing to find solution.
Use Ubuntu to create a start disk with Ubuntu already on it.
Pixel 2 now has Crouton/Ubuntu on it. But this Ubunto cannot play with HDs very well.
So fire up old eee PC. It has Ubuntu. So let's get it up to date and use it.
