Fish and Farm

In essence, Fish and Farm is the place where peeps staying 'upstairs' at Club Quarters come down to eat. It's also where - like many peeps in the 'hood - I come to eat. Why? Because Fish and Farm serves chef-prepared meals 24/7. 'Chef-prepared' means - hello - prepared by people who actually and truly eat the food they prepare. The typical Club Quarters peeps are airline staff, frequent fliers, former-bank robbers, whatever. In otnd the worher words, peeps, who need to eat tasty food or otherwise they are unhappy.

OK, you got the picture. So do start with the mussels. From Prince Edward Island. Cooked Mariniere - with garlic, parseley and vin blanc. Or try the Basquaise with Roasted Bell pepper, parseley, vin blanc and Spanish Chorizo. Then try the warm cheese galette and the artichoke sala.

The difficulty is the main course. Today there are eleven choices. I want one of each. Each dish is a North American classic. And, guess what, they are classy representives of their representations.  Each is good enough to eat time and time again.

Tonight it was a less frequented path: the vegetable risotto. And it delivered. The warm, cozy large _arborio_ rice was complimented by zucchini, broccoi and all goodly, healthy veggies to eat.

Um, but here is the real thing!! It has taken me three hours to write this review. Why? Because I am sitting at the bar at Fish and Farm and all these nice talkative peeps have sat next to me. I am a techie and I've talked tech. I'm born in Boston and I've talked East Coast. I do business around the world and I've talked frequent flier. What more can you talk/ask for?

Anyway, it's time to close and I cannot do so so without mentioning the general manager, Michael. Actually, I talk to him as Michel because he is totally French-speaking. Of course, he speaks a bunch of other languages. I do find that his Tagalog could use help. Whatever. The main thing is that if you want to have a photo-opportunity with a classy, totally well-dressed gentleman then you can do no better than giving Michel a hug

And, so, if yhttps://github.com/absence/absence.github.ioou want a tasty meal in the San Francisco Financial District 24/7, then Fish and Farm is a welcoming hang-out.

https://betterhumans.coach.me/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef


Every time you switch projects, open up your journal and enter the following three things:

1 Note the time. Most people will find having these timestamps to be useful to look back on.

2 Write a few sentences about what you just worked on. “What project did I just finish? Are there any parts of that project that I’m still thinking about?” Use complete sentences rather than one word answers. “Email. Yes.” is not a valid answer.

3 Write a few sentences about what you’re about to work on. “What is the first action of the project I’m about to start? How should I approach getting the project done?”


Rename Next Action to First Action.

First Action makes it easier to narrow in on a smaller action,


22:56 ~ killing email

23:14 ~  Youtube shortcuts
 To pause a video press K. To fast forward press L. To rewind press J. To watch frame by frame forward or backward, press the period or comma key.

Add more shortcuts to Auto Text Expander


## 2016-11-17

eeePC: Next day. Internet connection failed over night. Trying again. Looking good.

Testing testing 1 2 3. Can we edit using Codeanywhere with my Google Pixel C? Looks good.


Adding Crouton to Pixel was easier than I thought. Ubuntu looking good - though only r14 is fully supported.
Crouton means I can use Atom editor and Beyond Compare on the Pixel.The only issue is that logging out and sutting dpwn takes much longer.


Codeanywhere in the browser is a keeper. Links easily to DropBox. Edits text files very nicely. Works on all three Pixels.
Has auto save. Can refresh and see what happened on another device. Supports AutoText expander

Now how about them diaries??

Need a Google Apps script that open all 366 files and exports them to ASCII

Then would like a way that enables me to write sequentially, but add the data to the day files.

Also dashboard needs updating

Ditto new tab page

### Installing Ubuntu

_multo complicato_


19:10  trying to get ubuntu on thheop. Got all the wahy there the last time but shutting down instead of reloading was the wrong thing to do


20:10 https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/this-dinner-series-is-getting-people-to-talk-about-being-black-in-america

00:05 Wow! that took some time and some doing, but it looks like I have Ubuntu working on thheop.

the trick is that you have to install from one HD to another HD

Otherwise you never get to the Allocate size screen.

deciding to move my diary from google docs back to text.

Or Markdown. Which should it be?

looks like it should be in text format because then I can use voice recognition inside of Dropbox on my phone.




## Thheop

Thheep: BIOS reports HD is full
So remove hard disk. Delete some files
HD still has issues. OK let's move the machine to Ubuntu.
Rediscover bit but. But Thheop only boots from CD or HD. Many hours failing to find solution.
Use Ubuntu to create a start disk with Ubuntu already on it.
Pixel 2 now has Crouton/Ubuntu on it. But this Ubunto cannot play with HDs very well.
So fire up old eee PC. It has Ubuntu. So let's get it up to date and use it.
