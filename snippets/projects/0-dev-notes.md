Every time you switch projects, open up your journal and enter the following three things:

1 Note the time. Most people will find having these timestamps to be useful to look back on.

2 Write a few sentences about what you just worked on. “What project did I just finish? Are there any parts of that project that I’m still thinking about?” Use complete sentences rather than one word answers. “Email. Yes.” is not a valid answer.

3 Write a few sentences about what you’re about to work on. “What is the first action of the project I’m about to start? How should I approach getting the project done?”


Rename Next Action to First Action.

First Action makes it easier to narrow in on a smaller action,


22:56 ~ killing email

23:14 ~  Youtube shortcuts
 To pause a video press K. To fast forward press L. To rewind press J. To watch frame by frame forward or backward, press the period or comma key.

Add more shortcuts to Auto Text Expander


## 2016-11-17

eeePC: Next day. Internet connection failed over night. Trying again. Looking good.

Testing testing 1 2 3. Can we edit using Codeanywhere with my Google Pixel C? Looks good.


Adding Crouton to Pixel was easier than I thought. Ubuntu looking good - though only r14 is fully supported.
Crouton means I can use Atom editor and Beyond Compare on the Pixel.The only issue is that logging out and sutting dpwn takes much longer.


Codeanywhere in the browser is a keeper. Links easily to DropBox. Edits text files very nicely. Works on all three Pixels.
Has auto save. Can refresh and see what happened on another device. Supports AutoText expander

Now how about them diaries??

Need a Google Apps script that open all 366 files and exports them to ASCII

Then would like a way that enables me to write sequentially, but add the data to the day files.

Also dashboard needs updating

Ditto new tab page

### Installing Ubuntu

_multo complicato_


19:10  trying to get ubuntu on thheop. Got all the wahy there the last time but shutting down instead of reloading was the wrong thing to do


20:10 https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/this-dinner-series-is-getting-people-to-talk-about-being-black-in-america

00:05 Wow! that took some time and some doing, but it looks like I have Ubuntu working on thheop.

the trick is that you have to install from one HD to another HD

Otherwise you never get to the Allocate size screen.

deciding to move my diary from google docs back to text.

Or Markdown. Which should it be?

looks like it should be in text format because then I can use voice recognition inside of Dropbox on my phone.




## Thheop

Thheep: BIOS reports HD is full
So remove hard disk. Delete some files
HD still has issues. OK let's move the machine to Ubuntu.
Rediscover bit but. But Thheop only boots from CD or HD. Many hours failing to find solution.
Use Ubuntu to create a start disk with Ubuntu already on it.
Pixel 2 now has Crouton/Ubuntu on it. But this Ubunto cannot play with HDs very well.
So fire up old eee PC. It has Ubuntu. So let's get it up to date and use it.
