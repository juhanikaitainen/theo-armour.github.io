Dr Martin

Recovery from my surgery is going well.

Would you kindly arrange a referral for physical therapy with a medical diagnosis indicating medical necessity?

The left hip replacement in 2015, colectomy in 2017 and recent inguinal hernia repair on top of my ongoing partial paraplegia and left hand amputation hand have left me me in a significantly weakened state and at greater risk of falling. For example, I now require the use of my hand in order to stand up from a chair and this was not an issue several years ago.

It would be great if a physical therapist could look at how I work and live so as to help me develop a regimen that overcomes these issues.

I have been in touch with this practice:

I am a happy owner of a Dolomite Alpha Advanced acquired several years ago via mail order.

I have walked many miles with it and so the wheels are beginning to have issues.

Do you know of anybody person or organization in the San Francisco Bay area that could service the wheels?

Another possibility would be to order new wheels from you.

In any case, it would be great to hear about yours suggestions for maintaining my "walking buddy".

Under the Products drop-down menu on this site you will see the Dolomite brand.  Under the Find a Rep drop-down menu you will see four sales representatives who represent Northern California (http://clarkehealthcare.com/find-a-rep/california-north/).  Of these four, the VA people deal with either Debra Gruttadauro or Jeff Hopson.

Hi Martha

It took me until just a few days ago to discover that you are now on the list of UCSF peeps I am allowed to message via MyChart. I welcome you to a panoply of heroes. I look for to an occasional, ongoing, online dialog.

In your message of February you sent two links:

* http://www.seniorsonly.club/
* https://www.silversurfers.com/

I have been to both sites several times. At first I kind of poo-poo-ed them. But upon reflection, the level of discourse is reasonably high, people are very welcoming, and there are no trolls and no trash-talk. In this era of flame wars, being able to maintain a friendly community is certainly a really nice thing. So thank you for the introductions. I do plan to revisit them and participate in some ways. Thank you for this research.

Theo
