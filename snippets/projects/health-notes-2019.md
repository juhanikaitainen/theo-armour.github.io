Hi Martha

It took me until just a few days ago to figure out that you are now on the list of UCSF peeps I am allowed to message via MyChart. Welcome to a panoply of heroes. I look for to an occasional, ongoing, online dialog.

In your message of February you sent two links

* http://www.seniorsonly.club/
* https://www.silversurfers.com/

I have been to both sites several times. At first I kind of poo-poo-ed them. But upon reflection, the level of discourse is reasonably high, people are very welcoming, and there are no trolls and no trash-talk. In this era of flame wars, being able to maintain a friendly community is certainly a really nice thing. So thank you for the introductions.
