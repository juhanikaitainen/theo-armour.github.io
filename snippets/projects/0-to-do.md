Dr Martin

You will likely have me as a patient today and I look forward to the consultation.

The primary reasons for my joy is that the primary reasons for the visit seem to have eviscerated themselves.

My various back and leg pains are very much diminished - this happened overnight - and adult daily life ( ADL ) is returning for sure. Nonetheless perfection is not perfect or whatever and we must deal with the cards that were dealt. So I hav a number of issues where considered advice would be helpful and - fingers crossed - as helpful as yor past advice.

1. What are some of the canonical descriptions of the symptoms I have had?
2. What is a good mneumonic for pain assessment? OPQRST? SOCRATES?

## Books
Links to two or three books that provide up to date good diet guidelines.

I liked Willets' 'Eat Drink and be Healthy' and Weil's ''. I assume there are books of equal readability based on more recent studies.

2. I've been on Omeprazole since the beginning of the year.  For the first time in decades I have suffered no instances of food stuck in my esophagus. Your recommendation significantly improved the quality of my life. Thank you.

But as with many medications there are risks:
Proton pump inhibitors: Risks of long-term use / http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgh.13737/full

What is a workable, minimal interventions?  I tried Zantac for ten days, but felt food sticking so I resumed the Omeprazole. Since July I've been on a 20mg dose taken as you suggested 20 minutes before eating. When current batch runs out, I will try a 15mg dose. Might you have any observations or recommendations regarding these self-experiments?

3. We are scheduled for a colonoscopy December 14. As with my two prior colonoscopies, I plan for no anesthesia. if so, will it be OK if I get home without a helper?
