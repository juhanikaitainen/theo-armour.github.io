1. As promised, the Colorectal Surgeon Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N0w2rORwSc

2. I've been on Omeprazole since the beginning of the year.  For the first time in decades I have suffered no instances of food stuck in my esophagus. Your recommendation significantly improved the quality of my life. Thank you.

But as with many medications there are risks:
Proton pump inhibitors: Risks of long-term use / http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgh.13737/full

What is a workable, minimal interventions?  I tried Zantac for ten days, but felt food sticking so I resumed the Omeprazole. Since July I've been on a 20mg dose taken as you suggested 20 minutes before eating. When current batch runs out, I will try a 15mg dose. Might you have any observations or recommendations regarding these self-experiments?

3. We are scheduled for a colonoscopy December 14. As with my two prior colonoscopies, I plan for no anesthesia. if so, will it be OK if I get home without a helper?
