## Inguinal Hernia


An inguinal hernia occurs when tissue, such as part of the intestine, protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles.

## Documenting Symptoms


### History of the present illness

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_present_illness
* Several examples


### OPQRST

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPQRST
* Onset of the event
	* What the patient was doing when it started (active, inactive, stressed), whether the patient believes that activity prompted the pain,[2] and whether the onset was sudden, gradual or part of an ongoing chronic problem.
* Provocation or palliation
	* Whether any movement, pressure (such as palpation) or other external factor makes the problem better or worse. This can also include whether the symptoms relieve with rest.
* Quality of the pain
	This is the patient's description of the pain. Questions can be open ended ("Can you describe it for me?") or leading.[9] Ideally, this will elicit descriptions of the patient's pain: whether it is sharp, dull, crushing, burning, tearing, or some other feeling, along with the pattern, such as intermittent, constant, or throbbing.
* Region and radiation
	* Where the pain is on the body and whether it radiates (extends) or moves to any other area. This can give indications for conditions such as a myocardial infarction, which can radiate through the jaw and arms. Other referred pains can provide clues to underlying medical causes.
* Severity
	* The pain score (usually on a scale of 0 to 10). Zero is no pain and ten is the worst possible pain. This can be comparative (such as "... compared to the worst pain you have ever experienced") or imaginative ("... compared to having your arm ripped off by an alien"). If the pain is compared to a prior event, the nature of that event may be a follow-up question. The clinician must decide whether a score given is realistic within their experience – for instance, a pain score 10 for a stubbed toe is likely to be exaggerated. This may also be assessed for pain now, compared to pain at time of onset, or pain on movement. There are alternative assessment methods for pain, which can be used where a patient is unable to vocalise a score. One such method is the Wong-Baker faces pain scale.
* Time (history)
	* How long the condition has been going on and how it has changed since onset (better, worse, different symptoms), whether it has ever happened before, whether and how it may have changed since onset, and when the pain stopped if it is no longer currently being felt.[10]


### SOCRATES
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCRATES_(pain_assessment)
* Site – Where is the pain? Or the maximal site of the pain.
* Onset – When did the pain start, and was it sudden or gradual? Include also whether it is progressive regressive.
* Character – What is the pain like? An ache? Stabbing?
* Radiation – Does the pain radiate anywhere? (See also Radiation.)
* Associations – Any other signs or symptoms associated with the pain?
* Time course – Does the pain follow any pattern?
* Exacerbating/relieving factors – Does anything change the pain?
* Severity – How bad is the pain?

Links to two or three books that provide up to date good diet guidelines.


I liked Willets' 'Eat Drink and be Healthy' and Weil's ''. I assume there are books of equal readability based on more recent studies.
