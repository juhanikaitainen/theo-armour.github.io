Hi Everybody


Tomorrow I will undergo a Capsule Endoscopy

Capsule Endoscopy lets your doctor examine the inner lining of the small intestines, which includes the three portions (duodenum, jejunum, ileum). Your doctor will give you a large vitamin sized pill camera for you to swallow with a cup of water. This camera has its own light source and takes pictures of your small intestine as it passes through. These pictures are sent to a small wireless recording device you have to wear on your body like a belt.

The procedure is as follows:

You will swallow a pill-sized capsule. You will wear a belt with a data recorder for 8 hours. This recorder will be recording all the pictures that the pill capsule camera is taking inside your intestines. This process takes about 15-20 minutes and then you will be discharged to resume your daily activity. You will return the recorder belt to the nurse after 8 hours the same day.

The reason fo this is that several months after taking iron supplements and vitain D3, my hemoglobin level is still low. So there may be some bleeding and or other issues in my small intestine.

The procedure should be a piece of cake. Well, except no cake or anything else for 24 hours. The results - in a week or so- is what we wait for.





Dr Kattah

I am scheduled for a capsule endoscopy in your office on Thursday.

I do not know in any detail what may be determined from this test, but here are some things to consider:

My stool of displaying numerous air bubble indentations about a millimeter or tso in diameter about a centimeter or so apart.
Otherwise stool is a normal brown color and soft
I m noting an increase in burps and flatulence
I continue to experience occasional lightheadedness and tingling feet
Otherwise feeling fine and happy with life

***

I continue taking 40mg omeprazole and it seems to be doing a wondrous job of preventing dysphagia

I note that Walgreen's charges $175 for a thirty day supply of the 40 mg capsules.

Amazon will sell 60 capsules of 20mg Omeprazole for a tenth of the Walgreen's price.

I wonder if there are differences between the formulations worth cosidering.
