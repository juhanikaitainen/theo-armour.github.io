Creating schematics ~ not architecture or renderings
User is a DJ 
* Needs to hear before playing. 
* Everything that's doable must be visible from the get go
* Guns on every mantle piece: is something looks wrong there's a way to fix it
Feels like a game
Works on your phone / Works in VR / Viewer is another menu





## Ben

* Date for presentation
	* nov 9/10

* Presenting the Powerpoint you have shared? Or something else?
* Audience size? Type of venue?
* Any demos? Hands-on?
* Current work is to prove it's doable? That Three.js is a viable solution?
* Any specific correlation needed?
 * The more I do the easier it is for ME and Anton to do their work.

There's an event called BurningMan https://burningman.org/ now going on in Nevada, USA.

I'm remote hacking with  Temple 2017 http://www.temple2017.org/ and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma|analemmas> - and adding new features daily.

Animated GIF showing a pile of lumber transformed into a temple or a post-modern architectural deconstruction. It's all here:

Anyway. I'd like to do things like this with the current MicroHouse DXF files.

The issue for me is that these are in the AutoCAD R14 format of DXF. This format is far more complex than previous formats. I should know because I helped write the spec for it what I worked for Autodesk.

Is there any way that the files could be recreated in one of the earlier DXF formats?

Theo


PS There's nothing wrong with the R14 format but it had to handle 3D, PostScript, Paper space and more - thus it is much more of a beast to interpret.

@mostaphaRoudsari @mdahlhausen @MingboPeng 

NREL/EnergyPlus have a folder on GitHub with a small number of EPW files - probably for testing - here:

 https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/tree/develop/weather

This folder also includes their 'master.geoson'

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/develop/weather/master.geojson

This geoJSON file supplies links to download all the EnergyPlus EPW files.
