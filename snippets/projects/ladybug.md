NREL/EnergyPlus hava a folder on GitHub with a small number of EPW files - probably for testing - here:

 https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/tree/develop/weather

This folder also includes their 'master.geoson'

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/develop/weather/master.geojson

This geoJSON file supplies links to download all the EnergyPlus EPW files.
