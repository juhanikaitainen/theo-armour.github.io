## The Stimulus: 'In Praise of Theory in Design Research: How Levi-Strauss Redefined Workflow'

## My thoughts

The article 'In Praise...' is very much about the relation and contrast between _bricoleur_ and engineer.

In contrast, most of the derived texts I have looked at appear to concentrate on single typification of the _bricoleur_ and _bricolage_.


### What does this mean?

Good question.

I am trying to ascertain the benefits of have a system of comparisons in things such as [critical thinking]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking ). Where do [ontologies]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology ) fit into writing a good paper? How can a system of classification or [categorization]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization ) help you win an argument? But I am not having much luck.

In any case, I like being able to put things in camps, groups, baskets or whatever and this article on classifying peeps working on a project as engineers or _bricoleurs_ resonates. I felt the engineer as an architect talking to clients, as a program manager at Autodesk talking to end-users. On the other hand I felt the _bricoleur_ role more than once as a hospital patient or as a parent.


### Engineers
* Doctors are the engineers
* Priests and clerics are the engineer
* Lawyers are the engineers
* Judges are the engineers
* Teachers are the engineers
* School principals are the engineers
* Planners and policy makers are the engineers

#### Attributes

* Planned, researched, methodical, sane, the ant, conscious of past and future, death

### _Bricoleurs_
* Patients are the _bricoleurs_
* Laypeeps are the _bricoleurs_
* Defendants and plaintiffs are the _bricoleurs_
* Lawyers are the _bricoleurs_
* Students are the _bricoleurs_
* Teachers are the _bricoleurs_
* Residents are the _bricoleurs_

#### Attributes

* Ad hoc, random, crazy in a nice way, the grasshopper, living in the moment, life

### Which is which sex?

Another good question.

Depending on how you frame your perception it could go either way.

This will take a while to complete. The idea is to find descriptions that are compliments and might be agreed by significant percentages of populations.

Women as engineers
* Methodical about preparing meals, doing laundry, putting on makeup
* Planning for weddings, birthing menstrual cycle issues
* Know everything about their Facebook cohort

Women as _bricoleurs_
* Ability to create a new outfit out of whatever is in the closet
* Ability to create a meal out of whatever is in the kitchen

Men as engineers
* Many men are engineers
* Ability to plan and manage long journeys, campaigns and endeavors
* Investigate something _ad infinitem_

Men as _bricoleurs_
* Investigate something _ad infinitem_


The nice thing about baskets is that one day you can put things in one basket and another day in another basket. All that is needed is an appropriate rule for the matter at hand. Thus the baskets could be created by the engineers but the putting in the basket could be by the _bricoleurs_. Vice versa might be a bit tricky.

### Where do we go from here?

The is idea that two groups of people can look right past each other. Each group viewing the matter at hand in a very different manner.

The nice thing about the Selman/Petrie article is that it suggests that engineers may observe a situation, come to terms with the situation and then present findings or solutions acceptable to the _bricoleurs_. Win-win.

## Quotes

### Levi-Strauss, Claude. The savage mind. University of Chicago Press, 1966.

> The ‘bricoleur’ is adept at performing a large number of diverse tasks; but, unlike the engineer, he does not subordinate each of them to the availability of raw materials and tools conceived and procured for the purpose of the project. His universe of instruments is closed and the rules of the game always to make do with ‘whatever is at hand’, that is to say with a set of tools and materials which always finite and is also heterogeneous because what it contains bears no relation to the current project, or indeed any particular project, but is the contingent result of all the occasions there have been to renew or enrich the stock or to maintain it with the remains of previous constructions or destructions.

### https://www.epicpeople.org/theory-in-design-research/

> Further, Levi-Strauss exposes how our assumptions about building improved workflows is an engineering-based mindset. The word “workflows” itself implies an explicitly engineered system to solve a problem optimally using the ideal “raw materials and tools conceived and procured for the purpose of the project.” Real web browser users in the world do not think or act in this way. To build a programmatic, engineered workflow is to ask our users to understand and embrace an engineering mindset–which is contrary to their understanding and practice.4

> There are two primary reasons that we believe presenting theory worked for us in this instance. First, before we presented Levi-Strauss’s insights, we took U’s approach: our presentation focused on our observations without discussing their theoretical underpinnings. Our definition of workflows was presented as a set of empirical observations and analyses based on our fieldwork. After this description of our research, we presented Levi-Strauss’s quote in full. We believe ordering our narrative in this way made our team more receptive to Levi-Strauss’s theory as an additional explanation, rather than the primary explanation for our research findings.

> Second, Levi-Strauss’s theory of bricolage is clearly relatable to our audience and our team was able to recognize parts of their experience in the description. In this case, Levi-Strauss’s comparison between the bricoleur and the engineer provides insight not only into our observations but also into how our engineering team thinks about the problem space in general. Using theory to support our research findings allowed the team to gain a greater sense of self-awareness into their assumptions and how others without those assumptions might think and behave differently.
