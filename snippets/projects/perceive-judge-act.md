Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:[16]

* An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
* Knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning
* Some skill in applying those methods.
