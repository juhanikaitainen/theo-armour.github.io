## The primacy of the cohorts

How do friendships come about?

* https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cohort
	* a group of individuals having a statistical factor (such as age or class membership) in common in a demographic study
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort
	* a cohort is a group of subjects who share a defining characteristic (typically subjects who experienced a common event in a selected time period, such as birth or graduation).

### Important cohorts in a life

* Elementary school
* Middle school
* High School
* University

* Neighborhood / home location
* Work colleagues
* Service industry colleagues
* Leisure colleagues

* Partners
* Immediate family
* Not-so-immediate family

### Strength of the birth family cohort depends on

* Size of home(s)
* Amount of surplus capital
* Distances
* Amity

### Importance of the birth family cohort

* For infants and young children the family is the the prime cohort
* With growth this primacy decreases
* Eventually your birth family is just another cohort


* Unlikely a parent would be in one of your cohorts if they were not your parent
* Love of parents is a societal expectation
* Divorce/separation diminishes the the primacy immediate family cohort

### Importance of the generated family

* As children age, have partners and produce children they create a new tightly bound cohort
* This cohort is, however, just another cohort that may dissipate with changes in amity, wealth, distance, health, education other factors


### Intentionality of cohorts

* Some cohorts have highly intentional aspects
	* The volleyball team wants to reach the finals
	* The Sunday barbecue neighbors want their local team to win
	* The birth family wants to raise successful/happy progeny
	* A group of workers desire to achieve a certain percentage sales growth in the next ninety days
	* A high school class wants to graduate and go to college
* For the most part relations are highly accidental - arising from being at the same place at the same time
* The paramount dialogue is small talk

	* the need for some types of help may be rare; that is, the need to draw on help from the family safety net does not arise often in the general population.
