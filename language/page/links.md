## Literature Articles of Various Sorts

In my techie circles – when it comes to looking into creating artificial intelligence systems or voice recognition or any sort of natural language processing - Banko and Brill wrote the watershed paper. A PDF is available from here:

* http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1080000/1073017/p26-banko.pdf
	* And all they say is that when it comes to corpora: the bigger the better.
