> The worst algorithm beats the best algorithm when the size of the dataset is dramatically increased. The lesson is to look to max-out the data for the model and find the plateau before moving onto the next model.

> Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) is an electronic public access service that allows users to obtain case and docket information online from federal appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts, and the PACER Case Locator. PACER is provided by the Federal Judiciary in keeping with its commitment to providing public access to court information via a centralized service.

> This project is a collection of static corpora (plural of "corpus") that are potentially useful in the creation of weird internet stuff. I've found that, as a creator, sometimes I am making something that needs access to a lot of adjectives, but not necessarily every adjective in the English language. So for the last year I've been copy/pasting an adjs.json file from project to project. This is kind of awful, so I'm hoping that this project will at least help me keep everything in one place.

### Concordancers

> A concordancer is a computer program that automatically constructs a concordance. The output of a concordancer may serve as input to a translation memory system for computer-assisted translation, or as an early step in machine translation.

> Concordancers are also used in corpus linguistics to retrieve alphabetically or otherwise sorted lists of linguistic data from the corpus in question, which the corpus linguist then analyzes.
