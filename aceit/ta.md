# And what I believe in

I want to do something just like David and Caitlin

I don't really want to be against anything but I do want to be for lots of things

it's not that I am against Prejudice and inequality, it is that I am for justice and Liberty and peace for all

I want everybody to be just as rich and is happy and as intentional as I am if not more

growing old is a big challenge, I'm not sure I can live up to it
