The other day KevinT and and I were talking about cities and exploring interesting places to live - including Quito Ecuador and Charlott North Carolina.

There are wb sites that help you gauge the liviability of a city, Topics include aspects such as price of housing, crime raes and even the price of eggs.


This got me to thinking about my criteria for a nice city to live in.

Here are some of my thoughts:

When you walk down the main street you should see people of many, many differences

No window screens, snow shovels or air conditioners

Numerous, well-referenced Wikipedia entries for the area

A crime rate skewed toward the crimes that artists, poets and musicians commit rather that toward the crimes of confidence men, Ponzi schemes and bribery 

People tend to dress nicely

The number of graduate university degrees per square mile is quite high

You can get interesting vegetables by the bushel

There is a bicycle coalition

The signs on stores are hand-painted.

Restaurants and bars have encourage musicians to perform
 
There are semi-professional sports teams for every season and games are community events

Youngsters play sports more with clubs more than schools

There are tailors who can design and make clothes for you
 
People gather to sing

Every square mile should have a mix of housing for one percenters, homeless and usual suspects

Downtown should be as dense as a nice Parisian street - with shops, offices and dwellings piled one on top of another

When advice is need consult Jane Jacobs and _A Pattern Language_

Certain duties such as being a police person, sanitary worker and care-giver are civic duties just like serving on a jury

City government is really well documented and all codes by-laws are open-source

The hardware stores make some of their own hardware

You have never seen so many street market events

Awards are given for carrying out construction projects extra quietly

Libraries are fonts of wisdom

A good number of restaurants and bars make a point that you can be heard without having to shout. Except that a few days a month you must scream your head off

The obeyance of Jante Law is an ongoing topic of bemusement

The number of book clubs is astounding

Nearly all peeps are makers

Babies are carried much more than being pushed

Infants sleep in Finnish-style cardboard boxes place between the parents pillows

There are places and ways people can celebrate their differences

There are places and ways people can celebrate community

One year out of seven has to be somewhere other than where we usually find you

The encouragement of sabbaticals, retreats, times of silence are things we tend to shout about
 
The fish you catach off the pier are OK to eat

You can see quite a few stars at night

When you walk down the street, people look at you and say hello

You touch people and they touch you

There's more than one village idiot. I am one of them. But it's OK.

From time to time we all gather to clean, paint and wash things.

We adore barn-raisings

People come here to learn stuff.

Our house are renovated and updated using 3D printing building bots. We try to coordinate the process for architectural amusement, seismic safety and civic pride

People have places where they can keep fmily things in a visible, sharable manner. This allows them to go off and live in teepees or wherever

Young people are encouraged to learn how to sew a button, tie a knot, bake bread, play an instrument and other practical skills

Actually I really want to live in a place where these aspects do not yet exist.

But I can somehow be a real part it making it happen
