<h2>2019</h2><div><br></div><div>It's time to rejig my life.</div><div><br></div><div>there are so many projects that I want to work on but I am not spending enough time on them. There are so many projects that I'm working on that I don't really want to do.</div><div><br></div><div>The nature of the projects that I want to work on since from the fact that they are projects. They are events that have duration, commitment, change, improvement, learning and other fun factors.</div><div><br></div><div>The projects I'm not interested in or one-offs, repeats, of little intellectual depth or nuance.</div><div><br></div><div>Working on the first type I feel fulfilled, my brain is being used, I'm involved.</div><div><br></div><div>when working on the second type of projects, I ate too much, drink too much, get bored and frustrated.</div><div><br></div><div>it would seem that it would be simple just to stop the latter and work on the former. The difficult thing is that the latter type of projects involve very often people that I love.</div><div><br></div><div>on the other hand the first type of project often involves people on the internet people that will never ever meet or have any human interaction with.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, what am I going to do about it?</div><div><br></div><div>If nothing else, what I must do is write about it. For sure I am becoming old and crazy - just like so many of my friends - but at least it should be with a plan and a mission.</div><div><br></div><div>1121</div><div><br></div><div>no blood came out when I was on the toilet.</div><div><br></div><div>interesting article in New York Times about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I never realized the connection with Vector fields. this will entail me to study a field that I like very much to play be involved with.</div><div><br></div><div>it also makes me think that there may be some relationship between Vector feels and active category Theory (ACT). and these in turn could have some relationship with the contour line artwork projects I'm doing with Doug Dwyer.</div><div><br></div><div>I must work on getting an elder care manager for myself and for Diana.</div><div><br></div><div>1137</div><div><br></div><div>on the spider project I have been writing code in such a way that I expect people to be reading the source code. this is an anticipated audience rather than an actual audience. I must switch into writing software for whoever is watching the stuff now.</div><div><br></div><div>in other words while I'm riding for Doug Dwyer, I don't care what the source code looks like because all he is looking for is the effect on the screen when the software is finished working.</div><div><br></div><div>the benefit of this is that I can develop software much much faster.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
