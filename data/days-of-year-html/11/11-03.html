<h2>2019</h2><div><br></div><div>Sunday morning on a very sad day. We are back on standard time.</div><div><br></div><div>What am I going to do today? I have so many things I want to do. this is in stark contrast to when I was quite young and I was bored much of the time.</div><div><br></div><div>what I'm not sure about is this: is it because I am older than I have things to do or is it because it technology has so evolved so that I have things to do.</div><div><br></div><div>given that many people my age are just reading books and watching television and just passing the time until they die, it may have something to do with the technology that is now available to an early adoptor such as myself.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
