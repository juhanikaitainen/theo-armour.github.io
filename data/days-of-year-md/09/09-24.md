so I have copy the files over to my dropbox get hub place and can access them from gitlab.

on a PC I can edit the files with VS code. on my Android I can use the Dropbox editor. The only place that's an issue may be on the Chromebook. but there I can edit also on giqtlab

Good morning! here we are writing again. like yesterday, I'm not sure what I want to go today. The thing is that I've got nobody to help me on a daily basis with fixing GB XML files. Right now anyway.

so I'm thinking of working on writing kind of a cheat sheet or abstracts for all the different spider repositories.

did my hip ups. I can't remember when I started, but props it was 6 months ago. And I've been doing them every day almost without fail. things are looking good in terms of keeping hip ups as a good habit. also I feel I am doing them in a nicer better way. or that I'm getting stronger doing them. also yesterday I did 50

 minutes of walking and 20 minutes at the heartbeat rate. actually I think I remember the numbers incorrectly but something like that in any case well over target.
