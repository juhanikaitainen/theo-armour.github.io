Good morning.

so today I am going to work on seems and styles in my GB XML project. I could look it adding a no style feature instead of always adding this style. this will mean that the default style will be used. also I will look into make new style for GB xml.org.

one drink, one joint, finished by 9:00 p.m.

might be a good rule to live by
