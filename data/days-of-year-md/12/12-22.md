<h1>12-22</h1>

<h2>2019</h2><div>&nbsp;all the big to do things so you should plan your day or something like that. mornings may be a good time for writing just a little bit.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">What I'm concerned about is actually recording my thoughts.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br></span></div><div>it would be nice to do an annual review this year. To write down my accomplishments and failures for the course of the year. and then send this out to my nearest and dearest who would not understand a thing. or very little. well then would I understand it either. smiling.</div><div><br></div><div>***</div><div><br></div><div>oh, I like to use of the word 'smiling' here. emojis are symbols. And I'm very much against using symbols because many people do not understand what the symbol means. words are symbols to after all, but many more people understand many more things about words than they do about symbols that appear on things like Maps or in math or into physics. so maybe instead of doing emojis in texting., I should attach the word or phrase that I intend to convey.</div><div><br></div><div>***</div><div><br></div>
