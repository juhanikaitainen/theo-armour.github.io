### What is the purpose or meaning of one's children?

Given with all the parties:

* Your unconditional love is undeniably present and quite uncontested
* You are there for all the symbolic holidays and life events such as weddings and funerals
* You are there for any and all bad things happening

Given the typical modern circumstances

* When you are all adults
* When you children have no children and are unlikely to have children you will know in any meaningful way
* When you have different interests
* When you live away from each other and are in contact infrequently

### Quotes

* Me

The purpose of having children is to give your life a purpose. And when the children have grown up and can take care of themselves, what is the purpose of your life then?

I used to go to good restaurants, but I don't anymore. In the past, I set the calendar and could reserve the table. Now the agenda is controlled by mu children, I have no idea what dates are available so I dare not book.

> So when parents continue their roles 
* as emotional supporter, 
* as rapt audience, 
* and as tireless cheerleader, 
what they have to offer their adult children never goes out of style, never loses lasting value.
