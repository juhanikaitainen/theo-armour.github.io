### What is the purpose or meaning of one's children?

Given with all the parties:

* Your unconditional love is undeniably present and quite uncontested
* You are there for all the symbolic holidays and life events such as weddings and funerals
* You are there for any and all bad things happening

Given the typical modern circumstances

* When you are all adults
* When you children have no children and are unlikely to have children you will know in any meaningful way
* When you have different interests
* When you live away from each other

The purpose of having children is to give your life a purpose. And when the children have grown up and can take care of themselves, what is the purpose then?
