another wonderful day in progress.

Anna, Francisco and Nelly were here doing the cleaning. I invited them for dinner at a Guatemala restaurant in San Rafael when Eloise and Cynthia are here for Nicole's wedding. they seemed pleased and happy about this.

my new Theo dashboard is going really really well. fingers crossed it says a lot of clicking around and is totally easy to update.

this diary thing with Dropbox and voice recognition is brilliant. looks like I must get used to sense is not starting with capital letters. 

gitlab has some keyboard folding for markdown files in the editor, but sadly not in the IDE. it turns out that vs code has code folding markdown.

I built a demo for Paul Masson to show how you can have transparent backgrounds on his mathcell project.
