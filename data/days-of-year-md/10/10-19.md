oh, I forgot the way of editing these diary files on Dropbox. I think I just went to the end of the file, pressed enter and nothing happened. I forgot that you have to press shift enter in Dropbox. anyway, I can edit my diary coming and going. fingers crossed this is a life game changer.  but you will have to put up with my sentences being all lowercase for the time being.

the other big thing, is all the power that I seem to be gaining using bookmarklets, dashboards, and being able to use the browser to open up files in my vscode text editor. this could do several things. it would mean that I can do things with few or keystrokes. But maybe even more important it might give me access to places to store the data more quickly, therefore I store more data and create more content.
