here we are again. yesterday in the day before were pretty darn good. I did my 45 minutes and 20 minutes of walking, the latter being at a good speed.

I did quite a few teodoros. in other words I got a lot done.

the issue of course was that I spent the day by myself and talked to nobody. I did write to quite lengthy emails to Patrick and Shea.

also I only about a bottle and a half of one - the little airline bottles. I left a cute message in the garbage disposal area.   ...you are not special, be a good neighbor.



it would be nice if today went as well.

And it looks like Vicks VapoRub did a good job at stopping the scaling on my left foot. must continue

and I should remember to laugh and sing every morning

Would like to set an app with messages and links as my Windows wallpaper: cannot find

Would like app that pops up motivational messages on Chromebooks and tablets: cannot find.

Would like to be able to edit my diary files on all devices using voice recognition: cannot find

But it is fun looking and thinking about it.
