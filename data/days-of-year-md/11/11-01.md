we have just reinvented the laughing and singing club. oh what fun! The thing is that in the morning you should smile and talk and sing as you get up and wash and do the dishes and prepare for the day you don't need to be gloomy and just sit around and mope and whatever. you should smile in the mirror and move about and want to do it while singing and laughing. or something like that. And it reminds me of those Christmases many years ago in Mill valley and I'm thinking that maybe I should contact the members and tell them about my new discovery or something like that.

also while I was doing the laughing and seeing club I reinvented my Theo Armour logo.
