SMART goals are:

* Specific: Well defined, clear, and unambiguous
* Measurable: With specific criteria that measure your progress towards the accomplishment of the goal
* Achievable: Attainable and not impossible to achieve
* Realistic: Within reach, realistic, and relevant to your life purpose
* Timely: With a clearly defined timeline, including a starting date and a target date.


SMART Goal – Specific

* Goals that are specific have a significantly greater chance of being accomplished. To make a goal specific, the five “W” questions must be considered:
	* Who: Who is involved in this goal?
	* What: What do I want to accomplish?
	* Where: Where is this goal to be achieved?
	* When: When do I want to achieve this goal?
	* Why: Why do I want to achieve this goal?
