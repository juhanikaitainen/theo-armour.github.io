Hello, world! First post!

Add templates folder to http://jaanga.github.io/libs/.
Start coping updating some of my standard templates over to there.
The goal is to get more of my acquired knowledge out from being hidden under a rock and made easily accessible to the world.

Thinking about this dev notes file. First I though it should be in Jaanga. But since it is just about me, it should be in theo-armour.github.io.
I would like to be able to write/blog here on my local computer and have the text pushed to GitHub on a daily basis using a chron job.
