[Alt-Stoic Read Me]( https://theo-armour.github.io/#alt-stoic/README.md )
===
_say something Stoic here_



## Concept

### Issues / Problems that need solving
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

If you are an atheist, then establishing guidelines/precepts/codes of behavior is an on-going work-in-progress.

A fruitful opportunity may avail itself in the thoughts of the Stoics.

These pages attempt to provide a broad glimpse into the variety of Stoic thinking both archaic an modern.

***

How to decide what is to be acted upon?

We need thoughts that are modern. Replicating the life of two thousand years ago is not the way forward. We need to reinvent these ideas.

Coping well with adversity is fine. But we also need to consider beauty, creativity, sex and more.
