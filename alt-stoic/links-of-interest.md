### [Stoicism]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism )

Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting that which we have been given in life, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner.

#### Etymology
Stoic comes from the Greek _stōïkos_, meaning 'of the portico'. This, in turn, comes from _stoa_, the painted portico, in reference to where the influential Stoic Zeno of Citium taught - on his front porch.

#### Ethics

The idea was to be free of suffering through _apatheia_ (Greek: _ἀπάθεια_; literally, "without passion") or peace of mind, where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense—being objective or having "clear judgment" and the maintenance of equanimity in the face of life's highs and lows.

For the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature—the logos, or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.

The four cardinal virtues of the Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of Plato:

* wisdom (Sophia)
* courage (Andreia)
* justice (Dikaiosyne)
* temperance (Sophrosyne).
