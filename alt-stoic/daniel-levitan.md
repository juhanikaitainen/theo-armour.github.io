## Successful Aging: A Neuroscientist Explores the Power and Potential of Our Lives

SUCCESSFUL AGING delivers powerful insights:

* Debunking the myth that memory always declines with age
* Confirming that “health span”—not “life span”—is what matters
* Proving that sixty-plus years is a unique and newly recognized developmental stage
* Recommending that people look forward to joy, as reminiscing doesn’t promote health

Levitin looks at the science behind what we all can learn from those who age joyously, as well as how to adapt our culture to take full advantage of older people’s wisdom and experience. Throughout his exploration of what aging really means, using research from developmental neuroscience and the psychology of individual differences, Levitin reveals resilience strategies and practical, cognitive enhancing tricks everyone should do as they age.

Successful Aging inspires a powerful new approach to how readers think about our final decades, and it will revolutionize the way we plan for old age as individuals, family members, and citizens within a society where the average life expectancy continues to rise.

### Theo's thoughts


A feel-good book. As an oldsteer may place whereI cab "yes, I know that" and "yes, I do that" or "yes, I know I should be doing that."

Addressed to you, an individual is is or soon will be an oldster

* Nothing about we as a society can or should do
* Nothing about groups of oldsters, children and supporters of oldsters
* No links to tools or apps or spreadsheets or no ways to measure
* Notes section but no 'links of interest' section
* A surprising amount of talk about babies
* No forum
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_design
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_gerontology
* Alerts, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Alert
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderly_care
* Nothing about what you leave behind. No establishing a legacy. Online presence
* No new thoughts: schools for the aged, report cards or mental health assessments
* Baby 10 point action list but no real check list with metrics
* Traits, COACH other lists not linked or integrated with each other
* A number of Amazon reviewers say the book is disorganized and repetitive. ;-)
* Chatty easy read. It feels like a bunch of transcripts glommed together. Topics appear then disappear only to reappear later. A better hierarchy of headings might have helped
* Seems to borrow much from David Allen and GTD and also Peter Drucker, Hostader
* Nothing outrageous, far out or _avant garde_ about the points. A compendiun of knowledge from around the web.

### What Neuroscience Can Teach Us About Aging Better

https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_neuroscience_can_teach_us_about_aging_better &&& transcript


* the two most important personality correlates that predict successful aging are conscientiousness and openness to experience.
	* Conscientiousness is a cluster of traits that has to do with dependability, reliability, doing what you’ll say you’ll do, being proactive. A conscientious person calls the doctor when they’re sick and, when the doctor prescribes medication, actually takes it.
	* Openness is being willing to try new things and being open to new ideas and new ways of doing things.


COACH: conscientiousness, openness, affiliations, curiosity, and healthy lifestyle.

### ‘Successful Aging’ tips: Fight complacency, keep moving

* No. 1: “I’d like to change the narrative about what aging entails,”
* No. 2: “I’d like to start a societal conversation about how we treat older adults and change the narrative for what oldsters are expected to do,”

1. Work at being more conscientious. “Do things when you say you’ll do them. See your doctor regularly. If the doctor tells you to do something, do it,” he said. “Conscientiousness is associated with much better life outcomes.”
2. Fight the complacency that can set in from having lived a long time, knowing what you enjoy and not wanting to try new things.
3. Just follow healthy practices. “

A number of Amazon reviewers say the book is disorganized. ;-)

Seems to borrow much from David Allen and GTD and also  Peter Drucker

### Organization Principle #1: Conquer information overload

* Organization rule 1: A mislabeled item or location is worse than an unlabeled item.
* Organization rule 2: If there is an existing standard, use it.
* Organization rule 3: Don’t keep what you can’t use
* Every once in awhile it's perfectly fine to simply dump all that clutter and start fresh.

### Organization Principle #2: Quit multi-tasking and become fanatical about focused work

* Allow no distractions when you are in “focused work mode.”
* Limit the interruption caused by email, text messages, visitors, and callers.

### Organization Principle #3: Rest more, work less

* A calm, well-rested mind is a fruitful mind. Don’t overlook sleep, rest, and vacation as stress busters.


### Organization Principle #4: Organize your physical environment into categories so it helps your mind

* “offloading the information from your brain and into the environment” so you can “use the environment itself to remind you of what needs to be done.”

### Organization Principle #5: Spend only as much time on decisions, tasks, and actions as they are worth.

* satisficing—a decision-making approach that aims for acceptable or “good enough” results, rather than the optimal solutions
* Don't Obsess Over Organization

### Organization Principle #6: A Zen mind is an organized mind

* allot more of your limited attention to the present moment.
