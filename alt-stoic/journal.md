There are many philsophies but few agree. 

It would be nice to have some tools that would help compare and contrast various philosophies.

The phrase OODA loop refers to the decision cycle of observe, orient, decide, and act, developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd. Boyd applied the concept to the combat operations process, often at the strategic level in military operations. It is now also often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes. The approach favors agility over raw power in dealing with human opponents in any endeavor.

How does semiotics affect perception?

I had a nice, intense dialog with Andranik on the Stoics last night.

Nice thought from Andranik: The Stoic perceive, decide and act may be compared to the techie: input, process and output.

The more I look into historical Stoicism, the more I am bombarded by disparate, seemingly unconnected thoughts.

The more I look at Ryan Holiday's _The Obstacle is the Way_ the mor I feel at ease and ressured that there's stuff here I can understand.

And even with Holiday, I have issues. He says perceive, act, will. I prefer something like: perceive, decide, act. Rinse and repeat.

Not much here but you have to start somewhere.
