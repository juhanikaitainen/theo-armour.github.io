A good order

Perception, Judgment and Action

What are goals and objectives? mostly judgments

What is tennis? All three in quick succession.


Time mostly belongs to action. Perception and Judgment are timeless
A building is a judgment about the way thing should be
Cooking is a series of PJAs
1. We preceive that we are hungry
2. We decide to cook somthing
3. We search for a good recipe

Then
1 We perceive that there is a chicken in the fridge
2. We judge that a certain recipe provides a good way of cooking the chicken
3. We cook the chicken according to the recipe

and so on until we percive that we are no longer hungry


Now that we have PJA as the over arching set of categories, can we further define each one so that so that we get 'better' at it?

And what is this 'better' thing anyway?

 


### Ideas along the way

smart goals
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria

* Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
* Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
* Assignable – specify who will do it.
* Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
* Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/smarter-living/how-to-stick-with-new-years-resolutions.html

* Specific: Set concrete, clearly defined goals with specific points of success.
* Measurable: Whatever the goal is, find ways to measure progress.
* Achievable: Aim high, but within reason. Your goal should be a stretch, but something you could actually achieve.
* Relevant: Find a goal that matters enough to you that you’ll be motivated to stick with it.
* Time-bound: Set a reasonable timeline for your goal, and focus on the small wins along the way.

Perception, Action, and Consciousness

These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general observations that would cause someone who understood them to do something differently.

There are many philsophies but few agree. 

It would be nice to have some tools that would help compare and contrast various philosophies.

There are so many ways to think about things, its probably not worth thinking about.

The phrase OODA loop refers to the decision cycle of observe, orient, decide, and act, developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd. Boyd applied the concept to the combat operations process, often at the strategic level in military operations. It is now also often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes. The approach favors agility over raw power in dealing with human opponents in any endeavor.

How does semiotics affect perception?

## 2017-08-14

I had a nice, intense dialog with Andranik on the Stoics last night.

Nice thought from Andranik: The Stoic perceive, decide and act may be compared to the techie: input, process and output.


***

The more I look into historical Stoicism, the more I am bombarded by disparate, seemingly unconnected thoughts.

The more I look at Ryan Holiday's _The Obstacle is the Way_ the mor I feel at ease and ressured that there's stuff here I can understand.

And even with Holiday, I have issues. He says perceive, act, will. I prefer something like: perceive, decide, act. Rinse and repeat.

Not much here but you have to start somewhere.
