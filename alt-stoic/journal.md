I had a nice, intense dialog with Andranik on the Stoics last night.

Nice thought from Andranik: The Stoic perceive, decide and act may be compared to the techie: input, process and output.

The more I look into historical Stoicism, the more I am bombarded by disparate, seemingly unconnected thoughts.

The more I look at Ryan Holiday's _The Obstacle is the Way_ the mor I feel at ease and ressured that there's stuff here I can understand.

And even with Holiday, I have issues. He says perceive, act, will. I prefer something like: perceive, decide, act. Rinse and repeat.

Not much here but you have to start somewhere.
